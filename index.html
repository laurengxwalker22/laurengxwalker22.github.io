        We have a goldendoodle named Teddy, who is 8 years old. He is the mix of a standard poodle and golden retriever.

        <p class = "important">About Teddy</p>
        Teddy is very needy and sweet. He is quite large but thinks he is much smaller. He loves to play with other dogs and go on walks. He is sometimes too smart for his own good. He loves peanut butter and apples.
